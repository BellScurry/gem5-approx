                              GEM5-APPROX


WHAT IS GEM5-APPROX?

 - The gem5-approx is a simulator which evaluate approximate adder's effect
   on approximate float benchmarks.
   I'm on modifying gem5 to implement this simulator, gem5-approx.


WHY APPROXIMATE ADDER?

 - For HPC (High Performance Computing), energy efficiency is an important
   issue. Approximate hardware may be a way to resolve the energy efficiency
   problem, without significant loss of performance

 - For many floating point benchmarks such as computer graphics or neural
   network, it is acceptible to do approximate calculation


HOW TO RUN GEM5-APPROX?

 1. Edit local_config.txt
 2. Get a benchmark
 3. Run
   python run.py kmeans
   python run.py kmeans -a axa3 16
